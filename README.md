# Global Literacy Insights for Educational Enhancement in Developing Nations
### Overview

This project strives to enhance the quality of education in developing countries by identifying key factors contributing to low literacy rates. The literacy rate is defined as the total number of literate persons in a given age group, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. The adult literacy rate measures literacy among persons aged 15 years and older, and the youth literacy rate measures literacy among persons aged 15 to 24 years. 
The literacy rate, a crucial indicator of educational attainment and socioeconomic development, is analyzed through comprehensive data exploration. By uncovering the determinants of low literacy rates, this project aims to develop targeted interventions and policies, addressing root causes and promoting educational advancement
### Research question:

What major contributors influence the low literacy rate in developing countries within the domain of education?

### Objective:

To pinpoint the major contributors to the quality of education and literacy rates in developing countries and delineate significant steps for enhancing educational standards.
